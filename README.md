# MirkOgame-Bot-prototype

So here is my side project that I did to excuse myself for playing browser game. It's Tampermonkey userscript that communicates with php pages on server to send/get information from mysql database that holds data that bot does collect. 
Bot is in unfinished state but working, it was done to learn something so code actually contains few (or not so few) bad practices, as well as it does not keep any particular coding standard.
